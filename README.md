This repository contains the code for the RHH algorithm outlined in our master's thesis conducted at NTNU during the spring of 2023. The RHH is adopted to solve the LNG Annual Delivery Program with Speed Optimization and Multiple Loading ports (LNG-ADP-SO-MLP) described in the thesis. The thesis contains a study of relevant literature, descriptions of the problem and algorithm implementation and a computational study outlining results. A mathematical formulation of the problem is also provided. The pdf of the thesis is provided in the 'thesis' pdf-file.
